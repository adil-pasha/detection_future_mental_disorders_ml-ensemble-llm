# 🧠 Social Media as a Mirror: Mental Health Detection from Social Media Posts

This project presents a machine learning-based web application that detects **mental health conditions**—such as depression or suicidal tendencies—from **social media posts** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and multiple classification models.

It serves as a powerful tool for early detection of psychological risks through text analysis, enabling preventive mental health support.
